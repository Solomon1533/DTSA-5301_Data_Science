## Import NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic)
##The URL have a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC
##going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data
##can be used by the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity.
##Please refer to the attached data footnotes for additional information about this
##dataset. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Step 1 Start an Rmd document and loading libraries

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Loading libraries before starting data analysis provides us with the necessary tools, enhances efficiency, ensures reliability, and supports reproducibility. 


```{r setup1, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(patchwork)
library(treemapify)
library(gridExtra)
```



```{r import data}
url_in = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

nypd <- read_csv(url_in)

```

## Step 2: Tydying and transform our data. visualization and analysis: under this step it is crucial to uncover insights and make informed decisions. This stage 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
head(nypd)
```
## Data cleaning includes handling missing values, removes duplicates, correct errors and standardize formats.
```{r}
unique_values <- sapply(lapply(nypd_2, unique), length)
print(unique_values)
```

```{r}
nypd <- subset(nypd, select = -c(JURISDICTION_CODE, Latitude, Longitude, Lon_Lat))
```
```{r}
nypd_2 = nypd %>% select(INCIDENT_KEY, OCCUR_DATE, OCCUR_TIME, BORO, LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC, PRECINCT,
                         LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC, STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG, PERP_SEX, PERP_RACE, 
                         PERP_AGE_GROUP, VIC_AGE_GROUP, VIC_SEX, VIC_RACE, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD)
```
## Return the new data set
```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(tmap)
library(mapview)
library(viridis)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
lapply(nypd_2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
## Identifying data types are essentials for accurate analysis, effective data cleaning, appropriate data transformation and insightful visualization and optimization. There are  afair amount of unidentifiable amount
## of data in the data set. I will replace NA with "UNKNOWN"
##The data type need to be converted are the following:
**INCIDENT_KEY** *SHOULD BE TREATED AS A STRING*
**OCCUR_DATE**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**OCCUR_TIME**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**BORO**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**PREP_AGE_GROUP**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**PREP_SEX**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**PREP_RACE**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**VIC_AGE_GROUP**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**VIC_SEX**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**VIC_RACE**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**X_COORD_CD**   *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
**Y_COORD_CD**  *SHOULD BE TRATED AS A FACTOR*
```{r}
unique_values <- sapply(lapply(nypd_2, unique), length)
print(unique_values)
```

```{r}
nypd_2 = nypd_2 %>%
  replace_na(list(OCCUR_DATE = "UNKNOWN",
             OCCUR_TIME = "UNKNOWN",

             PERP_AGE_GROUP = "UNKNOWN",
             PERP_SEX = "UNKNOWN",
             PERP_RACE = "UNKNOWN",
             VIC_AGE_GROUP = "UNKNOWN",
             VIC_SEX = "UNKNOWN",
             VIC_RACE = "UNKNOWN"))
```


```{r}
head(nypd_2)
```
```{r}
nypd_2 = nypd_2 %>%
  mutate(INCIDENT_KEY = as.character(INCIDENT_KEY),
         OCCUR_DATE = as.factor(OCCUR_DATE),
         OCCUR_TIME = as.character(OCCUR_TIME),
         BORO = as.factor(BORO),
         PERP_AGE_GROUP = as.factor(PERP_AGE_GROUP),
         PERP_SEX = as.factor(PERP_SEX),
         PERP_RACE = as.factor(PERP_RACE),
         VIC_AGE_GROUP = as.factor(VIC_AGE_GROUP),
         VIC_SEX = as.factor(VIC_SEX),
         VIC_RACE = as.factor(VIC_RACE),
         X_COORD_CD = as.factor(X_COORD_CD),
         Y_COORD_CD = as.factor(Y_COORD_CD))
```
```{r}
summary(nypd_2)
```
#Step 3 Visualization

```{r}
g <- ggplot(nypd_2, aes(x = BORO)) + geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") + 
  labs(title = "Boroughs of New York City", 
       x = "Boroughs of New York City",
       y = "Count of Incidents") + 
  theme_minimal()
g
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(nypd_2, aes(x = "", fill = BORO)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "count") + 
  coord_polar(theta = "y") + 
  labs(title = "Boroughs of New York City", 
       x = "",
       y = "Count of Incidents") + 
  theme_minimal()

g
```

```{r}

  filter(STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG == FALSE) %>%

  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "Borough of New York city",
       y = "Non-Fatal Shootings",
       title ="Non-Fatal Shootings by Borough")
```
```{r}
shootings_data %>%
  filter(STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = VIC_AGE_GROUP)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "Victim Age Group",
       y = "Fatal Shootings",
       title = "Fatal Shootings by Victim Age Group")
```
```{r}
shootings_data %>%
  filter(STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = VIC_RACE)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "Victim Race",
       y = "Fatal Shootings",
       title = "Fatal Shootings by Victim Race")
```


```{r}
unique(nypd_2$BORO)
```

```{r}
colnames(nypd_2)
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
